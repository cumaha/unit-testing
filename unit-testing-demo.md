# JUnit and Spock Unit Testing Demo

## Introduction

This JUnit and Spock demo contains tests using both frameworks.

## Building and Running the Demo

This example is built and run using the build tool, [Gradle](http://gradle.org).  At the root of the project, simply execute the command:

`gradle test`

to run the tests for this demo.  Once completed, simply view the `index.html` file in `/build/reports/tests` folder.  Just for fun, change one of the tests such that it fails and re-execute the tests to see what happens.

Enjoy!
